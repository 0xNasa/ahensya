  <h1>Welcome.</h1>

  <p><strong>Ahensya is my personal advisory and contributor practice.</strong></p>

  <p>A high-context, hands-on solo firm powered by custom personal ai agents.</p>

  <p>I work with select founders, teams, and operators on new products, new business units, and high-stakes transitions.</p>

  <p>I started Ahensya after more than a decade founding creative and production agencies, lean startups, esports orgs,
    and crypto ecosystems—often as the founding operator or incubator tasked to will an opportunity from 0 to 1.</p>

  <p> > Built two startups that have been acquired (one solo): metasports.gg and djinn.app <br>
> Sectors with experience depth: IP Entertainment (Anime, Comics, Gaming), Fintech, Blockchain, Content Production, 0-1 Growth.
  </p>

  <p>My clients are sharp but self-aware enough to know when to get help. They need someone candid who can get in the
    weeds. Someone who can plug in, get to the root of things, and finally, execute. That’s where I come in.</p>

  <p>Currently: Select Consulting; and AI Pilled -> Agentic Building (Claude Code/Codex, Memory Research, x402 applications, Swarms and Harnesses!)</p>
